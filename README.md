This is a profile displaying my career portfolio 
a bootstrap themed template was use to display the formatting 
git hub path https://github.com/CynthiaHigley/portfolio
https://cynthiahigley.github.io/portfolio/

screen shot is in the img folder "portfolioScreenShot.png" 

the libraries were referenced in order to get the proper formatting 

a page structure was created to display the menu navigation on the left side which moved as you scroll down or you can click on a menu item to go directly to the proper page 

the left margin navigation includes About, Experience, Education, Skills, Projects, Awards. 

first page is the intro page with picture, contact information, resume on PDF, as well as links to LinkedIN and github

The Experience page gives my basic job history with the job title, company, skills used, and dates of employment. 
The Education pages give the school/institution, degree name or certification, focus, and dates attended. 
For the Skills section they are listed in icons representing the different skills acquired professionally and acedemically
   This has a subsection of Workflow highlight different techniques that would be buzz words for the work place, which might not translate directly into a language or environment but traits an employer might seek. 
Project is the section highlighting with a screen shot, github link and title the projects which I have completed to demonstrate my work capabilities 
The last section is the awards and certification portion giving me the opportunity to highlight things that set me apart from other potential employees. 

   
    <section class="resume-section p-3 p-lg-5 d-flex align-items-center" id="awards">
      <div class="w-100">
